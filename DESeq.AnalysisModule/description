[INFO]	DESeq: Differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution.
[INFO]	Estimate variance-mean dependence in count data from high-throughput sequencing assays and test for differential expression based on a model using the negative binomial distribution
[INFO]	As a first processing step is to estimate the effective library size from input file. This step is sometimes also called normalisation.
[INFO]	After Obtains dispersion estimates, i.e. the dispersion can be understood as the square of the coefficient of biological variation for a count data set.
[INFO]	Having  estimated  the  dispersion  for  each  gene,  it  is  straight-forward  to  look  for  differentially  expressed  genes.
[INFO]	In conclusion of nbinomTest function the output is one dataframe with data which will filtered from the defined parameters in R-Peridot.
