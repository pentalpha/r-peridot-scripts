This step is sometimes also called normalisation.\nAfter Obtains dispersion estimates, i.e. the dispersion can be understood as the square of the coefficient of biological variation for a count data set.\nHaving  estimated  the  dispersion  for  each  gene,  it  is  straight-forward  to  look  for  differentially  expressed  genes.\nIn conclusion of nbinomTest function the output is one dataframe with data which will filtered from the defined parameters in R-Peridot.\nAuthor: Simon Anders, EMBL Heidelberg <sanders at fs.tum.de>.\nMaintainer: Simon Anders <sanders at fs.tum.de>.\n",
