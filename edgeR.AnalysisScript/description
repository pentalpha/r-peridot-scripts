[INFO]	From bioconductor.org:[LINE-BREAK]edgeR: Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R.[LINE-BREAK]Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with biological replication. Implements a range of statistical methodology based on the negative binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq, it be applied to differential signal analysis of other types of genomic data that produce counts, including ChIP-seq, SAGE and CAGE.[LINE-BREAK]Author: Yunshun Chen <yuchen at wehi.edu.au>, Aaron Lun <alun at wehi.edu.au>, Davis McCarthy <dmccarthy at wehi.edu.au>, Xiaobei Zhou <xiaobei.zhou at uzh.ch>, Mark Robinson <mark.robinson at imls.uzh.ch>, Gordon Smyth <smyth at wehi.edu.au>[LINE-BREAK]Maintainer: Yunshun Chen <yuchen at wehi.edu.au>, Aaron Lun <alun at wehi.edu.au>, Mark Robinson <mark.robinson at imls.uzh.ch>, Davis McCarthy <dmccarthy at wehi.edu.au>, Gordon Smyth <smyth at wehi.edu.au>
